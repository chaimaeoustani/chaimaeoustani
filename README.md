# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chaimaeoustani

I'm a student of Economics and Applied Mathematics, currently diving deep into the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have a passion for programming languages, particularly Python and R, and I love exploring the intersection between Economics and these technical fields.
My journey so far has been filled with exciting projects where I've implemented economic models using Python and R. My goal is to make the field of Economics more accessible and fun by leveraging the power of programming languages.
Here's what you can expect to find in my repositories:
- ðŸ“ˆ Economic models implemented in Python and R
- ðŸ§  Machine Learning and AI projects with an economic twist
- ðŸ¤– Fun and innovative ways to understand and apply economic theories
I believe in the power of technology to transform and enhance our understanding of complex fields like Economics. If you share similar interests, feel free to connect or contribute to my projects.
Happy coding! ðŸ’»
